# Feature Behavior: Browser Agent Command

## Description
cursor-tools should provide an autonomous agent capability for browser automation through the `browser agent` command. This command should enable users to have an AI agent autonomously interact with web pages to perform complex tasks by making decisions based on page content and instructions.

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies and uses the browser agent capability
- Output contains information about all interactive elements on the page
- Output distinguishes between different types of elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- Command completes within a reasonable time

### Scenario 2: Autonomous Multi-Step Interaction (Happy Path)
**Task Description:**

- Console logs confirm actions were performed (e.g., button click events)
- Command completes successfully

### Scenario 3: Form Filling and Submission (Happy Path)
**Task Description:**
Use cursor-tools to have an agent fill out a form on a test page (form.html) with multiple fields and submit it.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should figure out how to have the browser agent fill out forms
- The agent should identify all form fields and their purposes
- The agent should fill in appropriate values for each field
- The agent should submit the form
- The result should confirm successful submission

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies how to use browser agent for form submission
- All form fields are correctly filled with appropriate values
- Form is successfully submitted as confirmed by console logs
- Command completes successfully

### Scenario 4: Data Extraction and Analysis (Happy Path)
**Task Description:**
Use cursor-tools to have an agent extract and analyze data from a table on a test page (table.html).

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should figure out how to use browser agent for data extraction
- The agent should locate the table on the page
- The agent should extract data from the table
- The agent should perform basic analysis on the data (e.g., count rows, identify patterns)
- The result should include the extracted and analyzed data

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies how to use browser agent for data extraction
- Output contains the extracted table data
- Output includes basic analysis of the data
- Command completes successfully

### Scenario 5: Error Recovery and Problem Solving (Edge Case)
**Task Description:**
Use cursor-tools to have an agent interact with a page that contains deliberately problematic elements (error-test.html) and recover from the errors.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should figure out how to use browser agent for error handling
- The agent should encounter deliberate errors on the page
- The agent should attempt alternative approaches to accomplish tasks
- The agent should recover from errors and continue with tasks
- The result should describe errors encountered and how they were handled

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies how to use browser agent
- Agent identifies problematic elements on the page
- Agent attempts alternative approaches when errors occur
- Agent successfully recovers from errors to complete tasks
- Command completes successfully with detailed error handling report

### Scenario 6: Navigation and Multi-Page Task (Edge Case)
**Task Description:**
Use cursor-tools to have an agent perform a task that involves navigating between multiple pages (navigation-test.html with links to other pages).

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should figure out how to use browser agent for navigation
- The agent should navigate between pages as needed to complete the task
- The agent should maintain context across page navigations
- The result should describe the navigation path and tasks completed on each page

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies how to use browser agent for multi-page tasks
- Agent successfully navigates between pages
- Agent maintains task context across navigations
- Agent completes required tasks on each page
- Command completes successfully with navigation path details

### Scenario 7: Long-Running Task Monitoring (Edge Case)
**Task Description:**
Use cursor-tools to have an agent monitor a long-running process on a test page (progress.html) and report when it completes.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should figure out how to use browser agent for monitoring
- The agent should observe a progress indicator on the page
- The agent should wait for the process to complete
- The agent should report when the process completes
- The result should include monitoring details and completion status

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies how to use browser agent for monitoring
- Agent successfully monitors the progress indicator
- Agent waits appropriately for process completion
- Agent reports completion status accurately
- Command completes successfully with monitoring results

### Scenario 8: API Key Validation (Error Handling)
**Task Description:**
Attempt to use cursor-tools browser agent without setting the required API key for the provider.

**Expected Behavior:**
- When API key is missing, the command should fail with a clear error message
- Error message should specify which API key is missing
- Error message should provide guidance on how to set the API key

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies the need for API keys
- Command fails gracefully with informative error message
- Error message indicates which specific API key is missing
- Error message suggests how to set the API key
- No partial or corrupted output is generated

### Scenario 9: Invalid Model Specification (Error Handling)
**Task Description:**
Attempt to use cursor-tools browser agent with an invalid model name for the specified provider.

**Expected Behavior:**
- When an invalid model is specified, the command should fail with a clear error message
- Error message should mention that the model is invalid for the provider
- Error message should suggest valid model options

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies model compatibility issues
- Command fails gracefully with informative error message
- Error message indicates which model is invalid and for which provider
- Error message suggests valid alternatives
- No partial or corrupted output is generated

### Scenario 10: Handling Complex Dynamic Content (Edge Case)
**Task Description:**
Use cursor-tools to have an agent interact with a page containing dynamic content that changes based on user interactions (dynamic-content.html).

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should figure out how to use browser agent for dynamic content
- The agent should observe initial state of the page
- The agent should interact with elements that trigger content changes
- The agent should adapt to the changed content
- The agent should complete tasks across multiple states of the page
- The result should describe the changing states and actions taken

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly identifies how to use browser agent for dynamic content
- Agent successfully observes initial page state
- Agent correctly interacts with elements to trigger content changes
- Agent adapts to changed content appropriately
- Agent completes required tasks across multiple page states
- Command completes successfully with description of state changes
