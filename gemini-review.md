Okay, I've reviewed the test plan in `test-plan.md` against the functionalities of cursor-tools, the file summaries, and especially the recent changes detailed in `CHANGELOG.md`. Here's my feedback:

**Overall Completeness and Adequacy:**

The test plan is quite comprehensive and covers a good range of `cursor-tools` functionalities. It's well-structured and organized by command, which makes it easy to follow. It directly addresses the recent changes highlighted in the `CHANGELOG.md`, demonstrating a clear effort to validate the latest updates.

**Specific Feedback and Suggestions:**

1.  **MCP Server Overrides:**

    - The test plan includes a test case for MCP `run` with overrides: `cursor-tools mcp run "using google-calendar-mcp list upcoming events"`. This is good and directly targets the new override feature.
    - **Suggestion:** It would be beneficial to add a test case that explicitly verifies that a _user-configured_ override (in `cursor-tools.config.json`) is also working as expected, not just the hardcoded override. This could involve a temporary config file modification for the test.

2.  **Claude 3.7 Sonnet Model Updates:**

    - The test plan mentions verifying Claude 3.7 Sonnet in the `ask` and `browser` command sections. This is important to ensure the model switch was successful.
    - **Improvement:** While mentioned, it's not explicitly a separate test case. Consider adding a test case specifically to confirm that commands using default models (where Claude 3.7 Sonnet should now be used) are indeed using the correct updated model and functioning as expected. For example, for `ask` command without specifying a model, and for `browser act` without specifying a model (if it defaults to Anthropic/Claude).

3.  **Stagehand Dependency Update (1.13.0 to 1.13.1):**

    - The test plan mentions testing with the updated Stagehand dependency, which is good.
    - **Suggestion:** It's not clear _what_ specifically about the Stagehand update is being tested. Add specific test cases that would highlight any potential regressions or improvements from the Stagehand update. For example, are there any known bug fixes or feature enhancements in 1.13.1 that you can verify? If not explicitly, then ensure the existing browser command tests are run thoroughly to catch any regressions.

4.  **Global Installation Recommendation Change:**

    - This change is more about documentation and user guidance than functionality. The test plan doesn't need to directly test this.
    - **Feedback:** The test plan is fine as is concerning this change, as it's not a functional change.

5.  **Validation for `--tag` in Release Command:**

    - This is a change to the release script, not the core functionality. The test plan doesn't need to directly test this.
    - **Feedback:** The test plan is fine as is concerning this change, as it's a release process change.

6.  **ModelBox and OpenRouter Provider Addition:**

    - The `ask`, `web`, `plan`, and `repo` command sections all mention testing with different providers, including ModelBox and OpenRouter. This is good.
    - **Improvement:** For each of these commands, explicitly include ModelBox and OpenRouter in the list of providers tested in the "Test Cases" subsections. For example, in `web`, add a test case like `cursor-tools web "Explain OpenRouter models" --provider openrouter`. This will ensure these new providers are specifically tested in each relevant command.

7.  **Browser Command State Management with `--connect-to` and `reload-current`:**

    - The test plan includes test cases for `browser open` with `--connect-to`.
    - **Missing Test Case:** Crucially missing is a test case that verifies the _state persistence_ and the functionality of `reload-current`. Add a test case like:
      - `cursor-tools browser open "tests/commands/browser/test-browser-persistence.html" --connect-to=9222` (open test page, interact with it)
      - `cursor-tools browser act "Click 'Button 2'" --url=current --connect-to=9222` (verify state is maintained)
      - `cursor-tools browser act "Click 'Button 3'" --url=reload-current --connect-to=9222` (verify state is maintained after reload).
      - Verify that the output and browser behavior are as expected across these steps.

8.  **Debug Logging Fixes:**

    - The test plan mentions using the `--debug` flag in several test cases. This is good.
    - **Suggestion:** Add a specific point to the "Test Execution Plan" to "Verify debug output is generated and contains useful information when `--debug` is used for each command". This will ensure that the debug logging fixes are actually validated during testing.

9.  **Default Thinking Provider Change to OpenAI o3-mini:**

    - The `plan` command section includes tests with different thinking providers.
    - **Improvement:** Add a test case for the `plan` command _without_ specifying `--thinkingProvider` or `--thinkingModel` to verify that the default is indeed OpenAI `o3-mini` and that it functions correctly.

10. **Default Console and Network Options for Browser Commands:**

    - The test plan doesn't explicitly test the default `console` and `network` options being enabled.
    - **Missing Test Case:** Add a test case for `browser act` or `browser open` _without_ `--no-console` or `--no-network` flags and verify that console logs and network activity are indeed captured in the output. Also, add test cases with `--no-console` and `--no-network` to verify they are correctly disabled.

11. **Page Reuse and Viewport Size Preservation in Browser Commands with `--connect-to`:**

    - Viewport preservation is partially covered by the suggested `--connect-to` test case above.
    - **Suggestion:** Explicitly add a step in the `--connect-to` test case in the "Test Execution Plan" to "Verify viewport size is preserved when reusing pages with `--connect-to`, and that `--viewport` option correctly overrides it".

12. **New `ask` Command:**

    - The test plan has a dedicated section for the `ask` command, which is excellent. The test cases are good for basic functionality.
    - **Improvement:** Add test cases to verify error handling, specifically:
      - `cursor-tools ask "Question" --provider openai` (missing `--model` - should throw `ModelNotFoundError`)
      - `cursor-tools ask "Question" --model o3-mini` (missing `--provider` - should throw `ProviderError`)
      - `cursor-tools ask "Question" --provider invalid-provider --model o3-mini` (invalid provider - should throw `ProviderError`)

13. **New Cursor Rules Directory Structure and `USE_LEGACY_CURSORRULES`:**

    - The test plan doesn't explicitly cover the cursor rules changes.
    - **Missing Test Cases:** Add test cases to verify the install command in relation to cursor rules:
      - Test `cursor-tools install .` with `USE_LEGACY_CURSORRULES=false` and verify `.cursor/rules/cursor-tools.mdc` is created/updated correctly.
      - Test `cursor-tools install .` with `USE_LEGACY_CURSORRULES=true` and verify `.cursorrules` is created/updated correctly.
      - Test `cursor-tools install .` when both `.cursorrules` and `.cursor/rules/cursor-tools.mdc` exist and `USE_LEGACY_CURSORRULES` is toggled, verifying the correct file is updated based on the environment variable.

14. **Dual-Provider Architecture for `plan` Command:**

    - The test plan _does_ include test cases with split providers for the `plan` command. This is good.
    - **Feedback:** The existing test cases seem sufficient to cover this feature.

15. **New Provider System and Error Handling:**

    - Error handling is partially covered by the `ask` command test case suggestions.
    - **Improvement:** In the "Test Execution Plan", add a point to "Verify error messages are user-friendly and informative for common error scenarios (API key missing, model not found, network errors, etc.) across all commands".

16. **`--quiet` Flag Addition:**
    - The test plan does not explicitly test the `--quiet` flag.
    - **Missing Test Case:** Add test cases to verify the `--quiet` flag works as expected:
      - `cursor-tools web "Test query" --save-to test-output.txt --quiet` (verify no output to stdout, output is saved to file)
      - `cursor-tools repo "Test query" --save-to test-output.txt --quiet` (verify no output to stdout, output is saved to file)
      - Test with other commands as well to ensure `--quiet` is consistently applied across all commands.

**Other Issues/Suggestions:**

- **Test Environment Setup:** It would be helpful to add a section to the test plan describing the required test environment setup, including:
  - API keys needed and how to set them (mention `.cursor-tools.env`)
  - Playwright installation instructions (for browser command tests)
  - Test server setup (for browser command testing, mention `bun serve-test`)
- **Test Data/HTML Files:** Mention the location of test HTML files (`tests/commands/browser/`) and how to access them via the test server (`http://localhost:3000/filename.html`).
- **Success Criteria Clarity:** While the "Success Criteria" section is present, it's quite high-level. Consider adding more specific success criteria for each command or test category. For example, for browser commands, success might include "Verify console logs are captured and formatted correctly", "Verify screenshots are generated at the correct path", etc.
- **Consider Categorizing Test Cases:** For each command, you could categorize test cases into "Positive Tests" (verifying expected behavior), "Negative Tests" (verifying error handling), and "Boundary/Edge Cases" (testing limits, unusual inputs, etc.). This can improve the structure and coverage of the test plan.

**In Summary:**

The test plan is a strong starting point and already covers many important aspects. By incorporating the suggested improvements, especially adding the missing test cases for `--connect-to` state persistence, `--quiet` flag, cursor rules installation, and more explicit error handling verification, and by clarifying the test environment and success criteria, you can make it even more robust and comprehensive, ensuring thorough validation of the latest cursor-tools features.
